0.01 Wed Apr 25 02:15:22 PDT 2004
	initial release

0.02
	- added more FFmpeg::Stream attributes (height, width, channels, etc)

	- FFmpeg::Stream made to be an uninstantiated base class for specific
	stream types: FFmpeg::Stream::Video, ::Audio, ::Data, and ::Unknown.

	- removed Inline::C dependency by reimplementing in XS (Dan Sully)

	- added capture_frame() method to FFmpeg::StreamGroup.  this introduces
	a dependency on Image::Magick::Iterator and Image::Magick.

	- changed Makefile.PL to read from $FFMPEG_ROOT environmental variable
	rather than a Makefile.PL argument.

0.03	- removed FFmpeg.PMS from distro (oops, should have been gone in 0.02)

	- added method for accessing header duration for RIFF files to
	FFmpeg::Stream::Video FIXME not done yet.

	- added input_url(), input_url_max_size(), and input_url_referrer() to
	allow customized downloading of files or their headers.  if
	input_url_max_size() is used, a second HEAD request is issued to get
	the real file size so FFMpeg::StreamGroup->duration() still reports
	the correct value.  this introduces dependency on LWP::UserAgent and
	HTTP::Request to the library.

0.04	- added force_format() method.
	- removed Time::Piece dependency.  duration() now returns fractional
	seconds for the duration of the stream or stream group.  call
	duration(format => 'HMS') to get a HH::MM::SS formatted string.  i
	may at some point add support for a 'Time::Piece' and other formats.
	- corrected a duration bug that reported incorrect durations for long
	streams (sprintf unsigned int instead of signed int)

6036
	- Sync to SVN version 6036
	- Added ffmpeg.c and config.h to distro, removing the need, in most
	cases, to define $FFMPEG_ROOT.
	- Renamed FFmpeg::StreamGroup's frame_rate() to video_rate()
	- Renamed FFmpeg::StreamGroup's frame_size() to video_geometry()
	- Added all command line options as comments to FFmpeg.xs.  Serves
	as a list of features to add to fully implement "ffmpeg" commandline
	program
	- Added extensions() method to FFmpeg::FileFormat.  Returns a list
	of file lowercase file extensions associated with the file format.
	- Added perl hooks for:
		* audio_bitrate (-ab)
		* video_codec (-acodec)
		* audio_rate (-ar)
		* video_bitrate (-b)
		* video_codec (-vcodec)
	- Added transcode() method to FFmpeg::StreamGroup

#TODO#
* finish documentation for transcode() options
* implement copyright/author/etc setters to be used by transcode()
* fix copyright/author/etc retrieval for the problematic .avi file in t/03.avi.t
