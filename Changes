0.01 Wed Apr 25 02:15:22 PDT 2004
	initial release

0.02
	- added more FFmpeg::Stream attributes (height, width, channels, etc)

	- FFmpeg::Stream made to be an uninstantiated base class for specific
	stream types: FFmpeg::Stream::Video, ::Audio, ::Data, and ::Unknown.

	- removed Inline::C dependency by reimplementing in XS (Dan Sully)

	- added capture_frame() method to FFmpeg::StreamGroup.  this introduces
	a dependency on Image::Magick::Iterator and Image::Magick.

	- changed Makefile.PL to read from $FFMPEG_ROOT environmental variable
	rather than a Makefile.PL argument.

0.03	- removed FFmpeg.PMS from distro (oops, should have been gone in 0.02)

	- added method for accessing header duration for RIFF files to
	FFmpeg::Stream::Video FIXME not done yet.

	- added input_url(), input_url_max_size(), and input_url_referrer() to
	allow customized downloading of files or their headers.  if
	input_url_max_size() is used, a second HEAD request is issued to get
	the real file size so FFMpeg::StreamGroup->duration() still reports
	the correct value.  this introduces dependency on LWP::UserAgent and
	HTTP::Request to the library.
