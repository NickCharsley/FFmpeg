0.02
	- added more FFmpeg::Stream attributes (height, width, channels, etc)

	- FFmpeg::Stream made to be an uninstantiated base class for specific
	stream types: FFmpeg::Stream::Video, ::Audio, ::Data, and ::Unknown.

	- removed Inline::C dependency by reimplementing in XS (Dan Sully)

	- added capture_frame() method to FFmpeg::StreamGroup.  this introduces
	a dependency on Image::Magick::Iterator and Image::Magick.
